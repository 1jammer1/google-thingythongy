      "message": "This change seems okay for the virtual devices, and for 4.19 IMO probably for all devices, however I\u0027ve asked the kernel team to take a look at this change for wider purposes. Those older prebuilts are not explicitly/fully compatible with a build from main but we can probably still build treble-ized devices at lease Year-3 from main so we may need to keep some of them, I\u0027m not sure.",
