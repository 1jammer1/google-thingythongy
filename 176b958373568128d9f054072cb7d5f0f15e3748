The first being ManifestServer so we can ensure that once the change lands we can keep building.  The other being buildbot itself (which has it\u0027s own manifest parser).\n\u003e \n\u003e Bug filed - b/145781459\n\nb/145781459 appears to be fixed. Is there anything we should do to test this?\n\nDid ManifestServer get fixed already, or only buildbot?",
