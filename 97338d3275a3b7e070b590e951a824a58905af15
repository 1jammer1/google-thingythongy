I wonder if it\u0027s a good idea to aim to document them in such detail here, because this file should be in sync with internal branches and every change requires manual cherry-picking.\n\nMaybe it\u0027s better to move all indirect dependencies to a simple sorted paragraph at the end of each section and leave it at that? Then we can have a doc elsewhere for keeping notes like this.",
